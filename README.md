# sim-arcade
An arcade sound simulation

I decided to look into the Youtube API and make an audio experiment. Overall I found it really easy to work with, loading multiple videos and controlling videos independently with JS.

My project is called 'Sim Arcade' as is meant to give one the audio experience of walking around a 1980s arcade. The closer you are to a game the louder, etc. Use your arrow keys and walk around. Game positions loaded randomly.
